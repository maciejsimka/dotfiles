# Fonts {{{
# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Medium
# italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic
#
# You can get a list of full family names available on your computer by running
# kitty list-fonts
# The default values shown below rely on your OS to choose an appropriate monospace font family.

# Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 10000

# Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The scrollback buffer is passed as
# STDIN to this program. If you change it, make sure the program you use can
# handle ANSI escape sequences for colors and text formatting.

# Color scheme {{{
# The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is opaque and 0 is fully transparent.
# This will only work if supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note
# that it only sets the default background color's opacity. This is so that
# things like the status bar in vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good.
# But it means that if you use a color theme with a background color in your
# editor, it will not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
# default background color in your kitty config and not use a background color
# in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set the terminals
# default colors in a shell script to launch your editor.
# Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
