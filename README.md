# dotfiles
my personal dotfiles

## emacs
emacs config is based on emacs starter for Clojure from "Clojure for the Brave and True", basically i changed naming to one more suiting for me and tried to go through every file there, understand what each line does and copy what i need
## git
To tell git where to look for templates for new repos:

`git config --global init.templatedir '~/dotfiles/git_template'`
