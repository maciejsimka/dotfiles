# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for ArchLinux/Manjaro/etc. and macOS. Managed by `dotbot`, topical structure inspired by Zach Holman.

## requirements

List of packages to install on both OSes can be found in `packages`. Besides that, this repo assumes these packages are installed:

* `dotbot` (via pip)
* `starship` prompt (via cargo)

And that default shell is set to `zsh`.
