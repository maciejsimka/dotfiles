# Rules to remember (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
#   Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#   Capitalize the subject line
#   Do not end the subject line with a period
#   Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   Wrap the body at 72 characters
#   Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
